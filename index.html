            <p>Everything that can be invented has been invented. (Charles H. Duell, Commissioner, U.S. Office of Patents, 1899) Computer science education cannot make anybody an expert programmer any more than studying brushes and pigment can make somebody an expert painter. (Eric Raymond) I’ve finally learned what ‘upward compatible’ means. It means we get to keep all our old mistakes. (Dennie van Tassel)
<br />
<br />
                As soon as we started programming, we found to our surprise that it wasn’t as easy to get programs right as we had thought. Debugging had to be discovered. I can remember the exact instant when I realized that a large part of my life from then on was going to be spent in finding mistakes in my own programs. (Maurice Wilkes discovers debugging, 1949) The question of whether computers can think is like the question of whether submarines can swim. (Edsger W. Dijkstra) PHP is a minor evil perpetrated and created by incompetent amateurs, whereas Perl is a great and insidious evil perpetrated by skilled but perverted professionals. (Jon Ribbens) Deleted code is debugged code. (Jeff Sickel) True innovation often comes from the small startup who is lean enough to launch a market but lacks the heft to own it. (Timm Martin)</p>
